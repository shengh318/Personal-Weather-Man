# Personal-Weather-Man
Arduino Personal Weather man that tell you the current date time and some information about the weather.

Now you don't have to carry your phone everywhere around your house to see the weather. Just set one of these bad boys up with a controller board and you are all good!

P.S. Made for lazy people
